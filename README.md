# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cars Dataset

This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cars dataset, aimed at understanding the characteristics, distributions, and relationships between various car features.

## Overview

This project focuses on performing EDA on a cars dataset (available from [Link to Dataset Source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, etc.]). The primary objectives are to:

* Clean and preprocess the dataset.
* Explore the distribution of individual features.
* Identify relationships between different features.
* Gain insights into factors influencing car prices or other relevant variables.

## Dataset

The "Cars Dataset" contains information about various car models, including [Briefly describe the key features, e.g., make, model, year, engine size, mileage, price, etc.].
